### 💭 Thinking

```
Let me break down this multiplication:
- 15 * 23 = 15 * (20 + 3)
- = 15 * 20 + 15 * 3
- = 300 + 45
- = 345
```

Let me solve this step by step:

1. Break down 23 into 20 + 3
2. Calculate 15 × 20 = 300
3. Calculate 15 × 3 = 45
4. Add them together: 300 + 45 = **345**

The answer is 345.
